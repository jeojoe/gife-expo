# gife-expo

Code style
1. Import/Export
    - Create `index.js` as entry point for all folders
    - Define in `index.js` how files in that folder will be exported (namespace, exported functions)
        - Export namespace is varied on type of folders
    - Import only from 'folder names' (except importing file within the same folder -> use direct name)
1. Naming
    - Begin with lowercase except `constants and React components`
